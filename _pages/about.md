This is Wan-Hsuan's home on the web.

I am a Ph.D. student affiliated with [VAST lab](https://vast.cs.ucla.edu) at the University of California, Los Angeles. I received a Bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2021. My research interests are quantum computing, automata theory, and physical design.
